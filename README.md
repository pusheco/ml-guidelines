In the common routine of ML projects, exploring data and feature engineering (e.g. handling missing values and categorical features) comes first, followed by normalization, training and evaluating the model. During this procedure, we may want to select hyper-parameters or do ensemble learning. This repository provides a minimal simple jupyter notebook framework to do these tasks in the right order.
