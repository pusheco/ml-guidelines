# ml-guidelines

In the common routine of ML projects, exploring data and feature engineering (e.g. handling missing values and categorical features) come first, followed by normalization, training and evaluating the model. During this procedure, we may want to select hyper-parameters or do ensemble learning. 

This repository provides a minimal notebook *(pipeline)* as a framework to do these tasks in the right order.
